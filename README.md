# Game-Development

## Overview

This project consists of smaller projects that I completed to introduce and familiarize myself with the processes of
game development. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and javascript to create different 2D features and games.

## Projects

### Project 1

This project displays how a parallax background functions. It enables a user to adjust the speed of the background.

### Project 2

This project displays various movement patterns for enemies within a game. It consists of four different enemies where
each displays
one of the following motions: vertical, vertical/endless horizontal, sinusoidal, and vertical/horizontal sliding.

### Project 3

This project creates an animation toggle display for an animation. It displays
various animations based on a user's selection.

### Project 4

This project displays an on click explosion image. This functionality is utilized for Project 5.

### Project 5

This project is a point and shoot game. Ravens randomly fly across the screen at various speeds and sizes. Upon click of
a raven,
it disappears with an explosive effect. If a raven gets across the screen without being clicked, the is game over.
